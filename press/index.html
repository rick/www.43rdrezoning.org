                <b>Notice that the property owner is dumping material inside his own fence.</b>
                Also, note the empty truck trailer.  At the April 8th Planning Commission meeting the property owner
                stated that he had arranged for someone to remove that trailer and that it was "probably already gone".
                <b>5 weeks later the trailer is still there.</b>

                A concerned neighbor requested the crime records from Metro Nashville &amp; Davidson County.

                  We've made the arrest records available here.
                </a>
                We've taken out the identifying information about who committed the crimes, but otherwise
                these are the complete arrest records for the surrounding area for the past year.  This includes
                arrests made up to 10 or 12 blocks away from the site in question.
                <b>
                  Our layman's assessment is that the property in question has a lower incidence of crime
                  than the Nation's neighborhood as a whole!
